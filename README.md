# Hugo Docker Image

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a fast and flexible static site generator, written in Go.
Hugo flexibly works with many formats and is ideal for blogs, docs, portfolios and much more.
Hugoâ€™s speed fosters creativity and makes building a website fun again.

This Lightweight Docker Image is based on Alpine, and comes with rsync for Continuous Deployment.

## Get Started

Print Hugo Help:

```bash
docker run --rm -ti chilic/docker-hugo help
```

Run any Hugo command:

```bash
docker run --rm -ti chilic/docker-hugo [command]
```

Create a new Hugo managed website:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/src -u hugo chilic/docker-hugo new site mysite
cd mysite

# Now, you probably want to add a theme (see https://themes.gohugo.io/):
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke;
echo 'theme = "ananke"' >> config.toml
```

Add some content:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/src -u hugo chilic/docker-hugo new posts/my-first-post.md

# Now, you can edit this post, add your content and remove "draft" flag:
vim content/posts/my-first-post.md
```

Build your site:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/src -u hugo chilic/docker-hugo -v
```

Serve your site locally:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/src -p 1313:1313 -u hugo chilic/docker-hugo server -w --bind=0.0.0.0
```

Then open [`http://localhost:1313/`](http://localhost:1313/) in your browser.

To go further, read the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

## Continuous Deployment

I use this Docker image for Continuous Deployment. You can find some CI config examples in the [`ci-deploy`](https://github.com/chilic/docker-hugo/tree/master/ci-deploy) directory.

This Docker image also comes with:

- rsync
- git
- openssh-client
